# Parking-Lot-Management-System

**Introduction:**
Urbanization has led to an exponential rise in vehicle ownership and an increasing demand for convenient parking solutions. One of the major challenges faced by urban dwellers is finding available parking, especially in crowded areas such as downtown business centers, university campuses, shopping malls, and event venues. Studies show that drivers can spend anywhere from 20 to 40 minutes searching for a vacant spot, which contributes to traffic congestion, increased fuel consumption, time wastage, and elevated levels of pollution.
Traditional parking systems, which rely heavily on manual ticketing, inefficient space utilization, and lack of real-time data, are insufficient to meet today’s demand. There is a pressing need for a more streamlined and intelligent system that reduces human involvement and automates the parking process.

**Our Problem Statement:**
Current parking systems are largely inefficient, fragmented, and lack automation. The absence of real-time information, poor space utilization, manual processes, and limited digital payment options result in user inconvenience and operational bottlenecks for facility managers. Moreover, without proper data tracking and auditing mechanisms, there is no reliable way to manage and monitor parking patterns or enforce compliance effectively. There is a critical need for a smart, centralized system that can automate parking operations, provide real-time availability, ensure security, and support scalability in line with smart city goals.
Park@Ease is designed as a smart parking lot management system to address these challenges. It offers a complete digital solution to streamline every aspect of the parking process—from slot booking and occupancy tracking to payment processing and administrative control. Leveraging a robust, data-driven backend with triggers, stored procedures, and sensor integration, Park@Ease enhances accuracy, security, and user experience. Additionally, it supports future scalability and integration with smart city ecosystems.
